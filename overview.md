## Why should kids even do this?

Most developers I talk to say there was an individual who introduced them to a love of code. That interaction changed their future. This was the case for me as well.  I don't think that every child is going to become a programmer but I think all of them should have a chance to try it out.

## Why should I volunteer?

It's more than just goodwill.  Teaching is is beneficial for developers in 3 ways.

1.  When you teach something to a child you solidify your own understanding of foundational programming skills.
2.  Working with kids will inspire you to continue to grow and try new languages, frameworks and code styles.
3.  There is nothing cooler than being part of that moment when a kid "gets it".  When that connection between their code and the outcome clicks it is amazing.
